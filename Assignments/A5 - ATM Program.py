# Constraints:
#   The balance cannot go below zero, so make sure you prevent that.
#   use string.rjust() as needed to make sure numbers line up properly.
#   Make the UI look good.
#   After each transaction, ask the user if they want to make another transaction.
#   Make sure you keep track of the amount in each account while the program runs.
#   Start each account with some $$.
